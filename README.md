# Standard Industrial Classification

![Industry](industry.jpg)

The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) is a system for classifying industries by a four-digit code. Established in the United States in 1937, it is used by government agencies to classify industry areas. The SIC system is also used by agencies.

In the United States, the SIC code has been replaced by the [North American Industry Classification System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Industry_Classification_System "North American Industry Classification System") (NAICS code), which was released in 1997.  However the SIC code is still widely.  

In the 1930s, the government needed standardized and meaningful ways in which to measure, analyze and share data across its various agencies. Thus, the Standard Industrial  Classification system was born. SIC codes are four-digit numerical representations of major businesses and industries. SIC codes are assigned based on common characteristics shared in the products, services, production and delivery system of a business.

SIC codes have a hierarchical, top-down structure that begins with general characteristics and narrows down to the specifics. The first two digits of the code represent the major industry sector to which a business belongs. The third and fourth digits describe the  sub-classification of the business group and specialization, respectively.  The fourth digit distinguishes the specific industry sector.
